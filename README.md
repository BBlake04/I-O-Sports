# I-O-Sports
This is a project utilizing an input menu to compare multiple strings between set players of sports or add players and then compare.

This projected demanded a lot of setters/getters, a ton of I/O handling, and multiple checks in if parameters to compare string data.
The menu allows the user to add an entry, check entries, compare entries, or check more specific info.
The code accurately handles incorrect input options and handles comparing user added entries to initialized ones.
