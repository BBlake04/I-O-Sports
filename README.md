# I-O-Sports
This is a project for comparing multiple strings between set players of sports.

This projected demanded a lot of setters/getters and a ton of I/O handling to compare string data.
The menu allows the user to add an entry, check entries, compare entries, or check more specific info.
The code accurately handles incorrect input options and handles comparing user added entries to initialized ones.
